10+ years professional experience in web development covering the full stack of technologies, back-end and front-end 
(although more focused on the front-end these past few years).

On the back-end using the .net platform, MSSQL, ASP.NET WebForms, MVC and ASP.NET .Core, on the front-end a mix of technologies over the years, 
the ones with most impact being jQuery, Angular and TypeScript.

An Important part of my work habits is keeping an eye for new technologies, finding ways to optimize and keep a clean code-base, 
all the while focused on sharing the knowledge with the team.
